# CivChestTracker

This is a 'fork' of [Chest Tracker](https://modrinth.com/mod/chest-tracker) for 1.21.1 that's [CivMC](https://civmc.net)
legal.

## Why?

CivMC has some pretty strict rules regarding bots and mods. Mods that read ANY block information for ANY purpose other
than an approved exception, are automatically illegal and bannable. And since ChestTracker reads the container-block
location and type, it is thus illegal. The admins have ignored requests to grant ChestTracker (and similar mods) an
exception. As such, the only way forward is to fork ChestTracker to make it legal.

## Changes

Nothing here yet.

## Requirements

- Fabric Loader: `0.16.5` (or newer)
- [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api): `0.103.0+1.21.1` (or newer)
